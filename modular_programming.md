# Case Study: Modular Programming for an Online Library System

## Problem Statement

An online library system is to be developed where users can browse books, borrow or return books, and review them. 
The system should allow administrators to manage the book catalog, monitor user activity, and generate reports. 
The aim is to develop the system using modular programming principles to ensure that each component can be easily maintained, 
updated, and tested independently.

## Goals:

- Implement the online library system using modular programming.
- Design independent modules with clear interfaces and well-defined responsibilities.
- Allow easy addition of new features in the future (such as new book categories, recommendation system, etc.).
- Ensure maintainability and testability of the system.

## Modules

### UserManagement Module
### BookCatalogue Module
